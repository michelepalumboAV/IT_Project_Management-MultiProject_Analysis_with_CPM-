# IT_Project_Management-MultiProject_Analysis_with_CPM

This project has been developed to provide decision support to all Program managers who manage multiple projects with shared resources that are, of course, planned by the various project managers assigned. Therefore, there is a vertical communication between the Program Manager and the various reference project managers in which the latter give precisely the planning of their project to the program manager.
The stage I decided to focus on is post planning.
One of the most difficult problems to deal with is to manage human resources linked to multiple projects, and then shared resources.
Then, you can analyse whether a given resource may be abnormally allocated across multiple projects, or if you are straddling multiple immediately subsequent critical tasks related to both the single project and the N-projects on which it is allocated.
To try to solve these problems, I decided to develop a software by following the approach of data analysis through the Critical Path Method (CPM).
The tools used to develop the software are: Neo4j and PyCharm, 
languages: Cypher and Python, 
libraries: pandas and py2neo
